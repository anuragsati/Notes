# MVC
architecture used to develop modern interfaces.

1. Model : data associated with app.
    how we control data
    e.g. databases, we can have models for databases that stores data
        and using that model we control DB 

2. Views : how we display things to client (UI)

3. Controller : 
    processes that are used to handle inputs.
    these modify models and views.
